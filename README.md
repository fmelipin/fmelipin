# 👋 Hello, I’m murd0ck

I'm a cybersecurity professional specializing in offensive security, with a focus on stealthy post-exploitation, red teaming techniques, and advanced malware evasion on Windows environments.

## 🔬 Areas of Expertise

- Advanced Windows internals & exploitation
- Custom offensive tooling in C# and PowerShell
- Endpoint security evasion:
  - Indirect syscalls & syscall stubbing
  - Process Hollowing, injection, and parent spoofing
  - AMSI & ETW bypasses
- Active Directory enumeration & abuse
- Web and infrastructure penetration testing

## 🧪 Current Focus

- Building stealthy C# loaders for AES-encrypted shellcode
- Implementing indirect syscalls to evade EDRs
- PowerShell payload delivery with runtime obfuscation
- Simulating APT-like techniques in lab environments

## 📜 Certifications & Labs

- 🎯 **OSEP** – Offensive Security Experienced Penetration Tester *(in progress)*  
- 🛡️ **CPTS** – Certified Penetration Testing Specialist (Hack The Box)  
- 🧠 **Zephyr Pro Lab** – Completed (Active Directory exploitation lab by HTB)

## 🛠️ Tools & Tech Stack

- Languages: `C#`, `PowerShell`, `Python`, `Bash`
- Environments: Windows (internal systems, AD), Linux (offensive infra)


## 🎯 Philosophy

I focus on realistic attack simulation, stealthy persistence, and low-level Windows internals. My goal is to bridge offensive creativity with technical precision to help organizations strengthen their defenses through better adversary emulation.
